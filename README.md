# 📝 Josh Coder Blog

# 🚀 Introduction

Welcome to **Josh Coder**, a modern and fully responsive **Next.js** blog designed to showcase engaging content on **computer science and programming**. This is the **first version** of the project, featuring an **intuitive UI** inspired by [my own custom **Figma design system**](https://www.figma.com/design/DuUW9np74Jp1SGHxKcy3Gf/Blog?node-id=59-1113). The blog allows users to seamlessly explore posts, search content, and navigate through various sections with ease.
